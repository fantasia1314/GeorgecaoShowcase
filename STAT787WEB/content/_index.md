Hi, I'm Chenliang Cao, but you can call me George. 
I'm currently in my first year as a graduate student at RIT, studying Applied Statistics. 
I've already earned a Master's degree in Data Science last year. 
This is my showcase website for my STAT 787 course.
Feel free to browse around and get to know more about my work!
